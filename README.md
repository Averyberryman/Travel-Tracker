## Retrospect

- This project was incredibly challenging and stretched the limits of my ability to code. I feel that a lot of my work was affected by the time crunch of buding a site from scratch in a week, and I wish I'd had more time to examine potential bugs in my code. While I do not consider this project 'finished', it is my hope that I've demonstrated that I've significantly furthered my understanding of javascript and GET and POST requests after having a lot of difficulty with the group project.
